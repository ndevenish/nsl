Overview
--------

Requirements
------------
Several pieces of software are required to build this package:
* ``Boost 1.34`` (minimum) is required for the ``thread``, ``filesystem``, ``system`` and ``program_options`` modules. It may be possible to rewrite a couple of these dependencies, but threading is pretty ingrained.
* ``CMake 2.6`` is used to generate the makefiles, to build the program.
* (Optionally) ``Doxygen`` to build the documentation.
